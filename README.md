Task: Breast Cancer Diagnosis

Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women and one of the major causes of death among women worldwide.
Every year approximately 124 out of 100,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer, and the estimation is that 23
out of the 124 women will die of this disease . When detected in its early stages, there is a 30% chance that the cancer 
can be treated effectively, but the late detection of advanced-stage tumors makes the treatment more difficult .
Currently, the most used techniques to detect breast cancer in early stages are: mammography (63%to 97% correctness ), 
FNA (Fine Needle Aspiration) with visual interpretation (65% to 98% correctness ) and surgical biopsy (approximately 100% correctness). 
Therefore, smammography and FNA with visual interpretation correctness varies widely, and the surgical biopsy, although reliable, is invasive and costly.


Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.
